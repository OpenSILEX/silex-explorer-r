## üìö Overview

**SilexExplorerR** is an R interface designed for seamless interaction with OpenSILEX platforms, enabling researchers to efficiently manage and analyze scientific experimental data. This package provides comprehensive tools for:

- üß™ Experimental data management
- üìä Data visualization and analysis
- üå± Phenotypic data processing
- üå°Ô∏è Environmental data collection
- üìà Time-series analysis
- üîç Advanced filtering capabilities

## üéØ Key Features
## **Features**
- **User Authentication**:   
  The `login` function allows secure authentication to an OpenSILEX instance and facilitates seamless interaction with its REST and GraphQL services by:  
  - Providing a token-based authentication mechanism.  
  - Configuring and generating REST and GraphQL endpoints dynamically.  
  - Preparing headers for secure and efficient API communication.  
  - Supporting custom ports and flexible server setups.  
 
- **Experiment Retrieval and Filtering**:   
  The `lsExp` function allows you to retrieve and filter experiments from an OpenSILEX instance using a GraphQL query. Key features include:  
  - Filtering experiments by species_uri, project_uri, date,species_name or project name.    
  - Returning results as a pandas DataFrame. 
  - Exporting filtered results to a CSV file for further analysis.  

- **Scientific Object Types Retrieval**:    
  The `lsOsByExp` function retrieves all scientific object types associated with a specific experiment from an OpenSILEX instance. Key features include:   
  - Filtering scientific object types by experiment URI.  
  - Returning results, including URIs and namesas,as a pandas DataFrame.  
  - Exporting results, to a CSV file.  

- **Factors and Factor Levels Retrieval** :   
  The `lsFlByFactor` function retrieves all factors and their associated levels for a given experiment. Key features include:  
  - Retrieving factors and their levels using GraphQL queries.  
  - Storing the retrieved data, including factor URIs and level URIs, in a CSV file.  
  - Returning the results as a pandas DataFrame for further analysis or processing.  

- **Variables Retrieval by Experiment**:   
  The `lsVarByExp` function retrieves all variables for a given experiment. Key features include:  
  - Fetching variables and their associated metadata (e.g., entity, characteristic, method, and unit) for a specified experiment.  
  - Saving the retrieved data to a CSV file for further analysis.  
  - Returning the variables as a pandas DataFrame.   

- **Scientific Objects Retrieval by Experiment**:   
  The `lsOsByExp` function retrieves scientific objects and their associated details for a given experiment and object type. Key features include:  
  - Dynamic filtering for factor levels and germplasm (both by uri and name).  
  - Supporting GraphQL queries to fetch detailed information about the scientific objects, including factors and germplasm data.  
  - Saving the retrieved data to a CSV file for further analysis.  
  - Returning the data as a pandas DataFrame, with optional filters applied for factor levels and germplasm.

- **Data Retrieval by Variable**:   
  The `lsDataByVar` function retrieves data associated with scientific objects for a specified experiment and object type. Key features include:  
  - Supports optional filtering by factor levels and germplasm.  
  - Extracts data such as target, variable, value, and date for each scientific object.  
  - Organizes the extracted data by variable and exports each variable's data to separate CSV files.  
  - Returns a dictionary where keys are variable names and values are DataFrames containing the associated data.  
  - The data can be filtered based on a provided list of variables (e.g., sensor readings, measurements).  
  - Saves the CSV files in the `temp_files` directory.

- **Environmental Variables by Facility**:   
  The `lsVarByFacility` function retrieves detailed environmental variable information linked to a facility. Key features include:  
  - Allows filtering by a specific date range (optional).  
  - Fetches a list of unique variables associated with the facility for the given date range.  
  - Retrieves detailed information for each variable (e.g., entity, characteristic, method, unit).  
  - Saves the variable details into a CSV file (default: `facility_env_var.csv`).  
  - Returns the variable details as a DataFrame. 

- **Retrieve and Export Environmental Data by Facility**:   
  The `lsEnvironmentalDataByFacility` function fetches environmental data for a specific facility within a given date range. Key features include:  
  - Retrieves environmental data and exports it to CSV files, organized by variable.  
  - Allows filtering by a list of environmental variables (optional). If none provided, variables are fetched using `get_variable_by_facility`.  
  - Supports flexible date filtering (defaulting to today's date if no dates are provided).  
  - The data is saved as separate CSV files for each variable, with a customizable prefix.  
  - Returns a dictionary where keys are variable names and values are corresponding DataFrames. 

- **Retrieve and Export Devices by Facility**:   
  The `lsDeviceByFacility` function fetches devices associated with a specific facility using pagination. Key features include:  
  - Retrieves devices data for a given facility with pagination support.  
  - Each device is represented with its URI, type, and name. 
  - Saves the retrieved devices data to a CSV file.  
  - Returns a list of dictionaries containing device details.  

- **Retrieve Measured Data by Device**:   
  The `lsDatabyDevice` function retrieves measured data associated with a specific device and exports it to a CSV file. Key features include:  
  - Fetches measured data for a device based on a specified date range (optional).  
  - Data includes device URI, target, value, variable, and measurement date.  
  - Saves the data to a CSV file, with a customizable filename.  
  - Returns the data as a Pandas DataFrame.  

- **Retrieve and Export Moves for a Scientific Object**:  
  The `lsMoveByOs` function retrieves the movement history of a scientific object and exports it to a CSV file. Key features include:  
  - Retrieves moves based on the object's URI, experiment, and optional date range.  
  - The moves include information about the "from" and "to" locations and the start and end times of each move.  
  - Generates a CSV file with columns: From, To, HasBeginning, and HasEnd.  
  - Returns a list of moves, each containing the relevant details.
