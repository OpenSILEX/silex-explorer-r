\title{Visualize Grouped Scientific Data by Variable}
\usage{
visualise_group_data(df_variables, group_id, output_dir = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_variables}{A named list of \code{tibble} objects, where each element
represents a variable and contains at least the columns \code{URI}, the
variable values, and \code{Date}.}

\item{group_id}{Character string identifying the group being visualized. This
identifier is used to name the output PDF file.}

\item{output_dir}{Optional character string specifying the directory where the
visualization PDF will be saved. If \code{NULL} or empty, the visualization
is displayed but not saved.}
}
\value{
No object is returned. The combined visualization is displayed on screen and
optionally saved to a PDF file.
}
\description{
This function creates a series of time-series plots (one per variable) for a
group of scientific objects. Each scientific object (URI) is displayed using
a consistent color across all plots. The individual plots are then combined
into a single figure using the \pkg{patchwork} package.
}
\details{
If an output directory is provided, the combined visualization is saved as a
PDF file named \code{"visualisation_group_<group_id>.pdf"} inside the specified
directory.


The function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
  \item Generates one time-series plot per variable.
  \item Colors observations consistently by scientific object URI across all plots.
  \item Automatically chooses between points and lines depending on data density
  and completeness.
  \item Collects and displays a shared legend at the bottom of the figure.
  \item Combines all plots into a single layout using \code{patchwork}.
  \item Saves the visualization as a PDF file if \code{output_dir} is provided.
}

The output file is saved using the following pattern:
\preformatted{
output_dir/visualisation_group_<group_id>.pdf
}
}
