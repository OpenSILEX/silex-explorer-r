\title{Group Scientific Objects by Attribute Similarity}
\usage{
group_scientific_objects(df, output_dir = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame where each row represents a scientific object and
columns represent object attributes.}

\item{output_dir}{Optional character string specifying a directory where a CSV
summary of group sizes will be saved. If \code{NULL}, no file is written.}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames.
Each element of the list corresponds to one group of similar objects.
The names of the list elements are the group identifiers.
}
\description{
This function groups scientific objects (rows of a data frame) according to
identical combinations of their attribute values.
Two objects belong to the same group if they share the same values across all
relevant attributes after normalization.
}
\details{
The columns \code{uri} and \code{name} are excluded from the grouping process,
as they are assumed to be identifiers rather than discriminative attributes.


The grouping process follows these steps:
\itemize{
  \item Columns \code{uri} and \code{name} are excluded from comparison.
  \item Columns with identical values for all rows are ignored, as they do not
  contribute to distinguishing objects.
  \item Missing values (\code{NA}) and empty strings are replaced with the
  string \code{"NaN"}.
  \item A group identifier is created by concatenating attribute values with
  underscores.
  \item Trailing \code{"_NaN"} suffixes at the end of an identifier are removed
  using \code{remove_trailing_nans_from_identifier()}.
  \item Objects whose attributes are all missing are assigned to a default
  group named \code{"NaN_group"}.
}

If \code{output_dir} is provided, a CSV file named
\code{"group_summary.csv"} is created, listing each group identifier and the
number of objects it contains.

\examples{
\dontrun{
groups <- group_scientific_objects(df, output_dir = "results/")
names(groups)           # group identifiers
nrow(groups[[1]])       # number of objects in the first group
}
